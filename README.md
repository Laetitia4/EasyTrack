# EasyTrack
EasyTrack is a GPS-based car geolocation application crafted by a group of young and innovative minds hailing from Cameroon. 
This application seamlessly integrates cutting-edge technology to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for tracking vehicles in real-time.

Designed with the needs of modern vehicle owners and fleet managers in mind, EasyTrack offers a wide array of features aimed at enhancing convenience, security, and operational efficiency. Users can easily install the EasyTrack app on their smartphones or access it through a web interface, ensuring accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection.

Key features of EasyTrack include:

Real-time Tracking: The application leverages GPS technology to offer precise real-time tracking of vehicles. This allows users to monitor their vehicle's location, speed, and route history in a seamless and accurate manner.

Geo-fencing: EasyTrack enables users to set up virtual geographical boundaries, known as geo-fences, around specific areas. Whenever a vehicle enters or exits these predefined zones, the application sends instant notifications to the user, enhancing security and enabling efficient fleet management.

History Playback: The app offers a playback feature that allows users to review historical location data and routes taken by their vehicles. This functionality is particularly useful for analyzing past trips and optimizing routes.

Anti-theft Measures: In case of unauthorized movement or theft, EasyTrack provides an anti-theft feature that notifies users immediately. This enables quick response and increases the chances of vehicle recovery.

Notifications: The application sends timely alerts for various events, including geo-fence breaches, speeding, maintenance reminders, and low battery voltage, helping users stay informed about their vehicle's status.

User Profiles: EasyTrack supports the creation of user profiles for individual vehicle owners and fleet managers. This allows for differentiated access levels and tailored tracking settings to suit the needs of different users. <img width="212" alt="2023-08-09 18_55_10-WhatsApp Video 2023-08-09 at 6 03 59 PM mp4 - PotPlayer" src="https://github.com/Laetitia4/EasyTrack/assets/116858016/3644fa7f-f71d-4ba3-a956-0b49985bf193">
